                Transitioning from a science background to the techology field,
                back in 2018, has been the greatest decision Ive ever made.
                <br/><br/>

                For the past 5 years, I had many opportunities to work in a vast 
                spectrum of web technologies, which allowed me acquire a significant
                amount of experience. Working for companies and aspiring individuals, I met 
                and learnt from ambitious people.
                <br/><br/>

                I currently work remotely with a company, being open for new opportunities.
